<b>Mike Beedle</b> is the founder and CEO of e-Architects Inc., a
consulting company that specializes in application development
using distributed objects and Internet technologies.  Despite
Mike's business demands, he has remained billing
as an on-the-trenches consultant where he applies Scrum and XP
together through <a href="http://www.xbreed.net">XBreed</a>.
Mike was privileged to be an early adopter of the Scrum method, and
has introduced Scrum to 7 organizations since the mid-90's.  Mike's
specialty is to coach companies in the creation of large scale
reusable architectures involving many application teams.  His record
so far is 17 applications reusing the same components such as: workflows,
visual components, transactions, business objects and architectural
services.  Mike has published in several areas including
object technology, patterns, components, frameworks, software development,
programming languages, reusability, workflow, BPR, and Physics.
He has co-organized several workshops on objects, patterns, components,
and software development through the last decade.  He is co-author
of <i>Scrum, Agile Software Development</i> with Ken Schwaber
(Prentice Hall, fall 2001), a provocative book that assumes
software development is more like <i>new product development</i>
than the manufacturing-like processes that the software industry
has used for the last 20 years.

<b>Arie van Bennekum</b> has been actively involved in DSDM and the <a href=
http://www.dsdm.org>DSDM Consortium</a>  since 1997. Before that he had been
working with Rapid Application Development. His passion for agile methods is based
on delivering to customers what they really need in a way that really suits end-
users and business. Because facilitated sessions are very important within the
DSDM method and his passion for group processes and human behaviour, he is very
often involved in projects as facilitator and coach. At this moment in time he is
a member of the board of DSDM Consortium Benelux and accredited as a DSDM-
practitioner, DSDM-trainer, DSDM Consultant and IAF Certified Professional
Facilitator (CPF).

<b>Alistair Cockburn</b>, founder of <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/acockburn">
Humans and Technology</A>, is known for his extensive interviews of project teams.
These interviews, together with his active participation on live projects, form
the basis for his methodology designs: light but sufficient, and self-evolving.
Alistair's work in the 1990s grew into the Crystal family of agile methodologies.
Alistair and Jim Highsmith are now working together to evolve Crystal and the
Adaptive ideas into recommendations for creating agile software development
ecosystems, the meeting of generic methodology with a project team's specific
situation. Alistair and Jim are co-sponsoring the Agile Software Development book
series to publish techniques for personal growth and examples of agile
methodologies that have been used successfully.

Thoughtworks, an application development and consulting company. He's been involved for
over a decade in using object-oriented techniques for information systems. Although his
primary interest has been in software design he's never been able to avoid software
process and has been interested in approaches that allow methodology to fit people
rather than the other way around. He's the author of Analysis Patterns, UML Distilled,
Refactoring, and Planning Extreme Programming.

<b>Jon Kern</b>
is passionate about helping clients succeed in delivering business value through software development efforts. His varied career has spanned jet engine R&D through centrifuge-based flight simulators, to being an object-oriented evangelist through the 90s beginning with C++ and moving to Java. He first published his lightweight iterative development methodology in (strangely enough) developers guides for Lotus Notes 4.5 and 5.0. He was motivated heavily by his friend Peter Coad's mantra to deliver "frequent, tangible, working results." He put his techniques to work on DoD projects, and then at his own company (Lightship, Inc.). In 1999, he joined Peter Coad for the start up of TogetherSoft, where he created the professional mentor group, and guided product development. Jon was a co-author of Java Design, and worked with Peter and Jeff De Luca (the primary contributor to FDD) to help shape the chapter on Feature-Driven Development (FDD) in Java Modeling in Color with UML. Jon constantly seeks better ways for teams to accomplish their goals, from a technology perspective and from a process and methodology perspective. In Jon's words, Pragmatic MDA via Compuware's OptimalJ (http://www.optimalj.com) represents an exciting, revolutionary advancement in having an environment that promotes best practices, solid architecture, agile development, quality by design (not accident), and laser-like focus on delivering business value through strategic use of IT resources.

<b>Dave Thomas</b> believes
that the heart of a project is not the methodology but the
people. Members of the team need to be technically competent,
motivated, and aligned. This focus on the individual was one of the
reasons he co-authored <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">The
Pragmatic Programmer</a>.  But the technical side is not enough. Each
team member must also be involved: involved in their work,
involved in their team, and involved in their organization. Dave and
Andy are now working on ways to help individuals make the transition
to Agile methodologies.
