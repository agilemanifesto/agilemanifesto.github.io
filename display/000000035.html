<a href="mailto:mahesh.mulchandani@gmail.com">Mahesh Mulchandani</a>:  (L10nBridge India) Agile Methods are not just methods but CULTURE to be sown and nurtured across organization, user groups and industries.

For a IT Professional Agile is a WAY OF LIFE, which induces sense of participation, contribution and collabration rather than following rigid and outdated PROCESSES and TOOLS.<hr>
<b>Thomas Purcell</b>: The Manifesto captures the concept that we should work together.  A good philosophy for life, not just programming.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sorcer76@yahoo.com">lynn kelkeys</a>: I think the &quot;individuals and interactions over processes and tools&quot; should be expanded to include &quot;People before Corporations&quot;. 

While you may think this is outside the boundary of a software development concept or belief, it really is an extention of the value mentioned above. The corporate mindset is devaluing the individual&#39;s worth at an ever increasing rate. The simple statement &quot;Everything is personal&quot;, sums up the idea. Please comment..<hr>

<b>Chris Kourelakos</b>:  (TIAA-CREF) I&#39;m glad someone finally stated what I&#39;ve been practicing since I first got involved in the IT world - nearly 30 years now<hr>
<a href="mailto:dynotech@msn.com">Dave Carlson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dynotech.com">DynoTech Software</a>) &quot;Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.&quot; DynoTech Development Theory: Work together and trust them to get the job done.<hr>
<a href="mailto:eldridgemartinez@gmail.com">Eldridge T. Martinez</a>: I want to share my knowledge and at the same time cater knowledge from you experts.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kbowd@tentendigital.com">Kevin Bowd</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tentendigital.com">tentendigital</a>) encourage change to give the customer competitive edge....and measure progress by software and not documentation.  That&#39;s what I love about the manifesto!!!<hr>
<a href="mailto:fancherr_2000@yahoo.com">Robert Fancher</a>: I support this manifesto. But how do we change? The whole team has to change. How can I convince management to support the change??? This is something for me to work on.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dave@lastparty.co.uk">Dave Dempsey</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lastparty.co.uk">Lastparty Ltd.</a>) It&#39;s good to see such common-sense ideas acquiring a name and status.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:rwood25370@aol.com">Raymond Wood</a>:  (Independant International Consultant) At last a pragmatic approach which goes back to the basics of customer facing interactive development! Let&#39;s hope people will see the light and we can move away from projects staffed with armies of people who know nothing about IT, Computers or the business, but can list a 1,000 reasons why you can&#39;t proceed with a simple, customer driven modification.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ajaeconsult@gmail.com">Rob Schulz</a>:  (AJAE Consulting Ltd.) Many software development methods and practices focus on trying to build a better bridge paved with documentation, between the two islands of software developers and clients.  As a project manager, I prefer to be a boat captain, bringing one group to meet the other and work together on a solution. It has proven more successful this way! I agree and support this manifesto.<hr>

<a href="mailto:james.schiel@siemens.com">James Schiel</a>:  (<a href="http://www.smed.com">Siemens Medical Solutions</a>) After too many years as a manager of development teams, it has become clearly obvious that software development is more an art form than a process and that defined processes would be no more effective for the creation of a new product than in the painting of &quot;Starry Night.&quot; My organization is committed to the Agile Manifesto and in spreading that commitment as far in our company and parent company as we possibly can manage.<hr>

<b>Mohan Radhakrishnan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.accenture.com">Accenture</a>) After having burnt my fingers working on a fixed price single-pass model for a ODC, I want to adopt a more flexible approach. I understand and like agility even though I am looking for help to introduce and gain experience in a real-time environment because I have to go to one country to gather requirements and code in another.<hr>

<a href="mailto:nazimpethani@hotmail.com">Nazim Pethani</a>: Wow. This is a process that I definitely agree with. As a developer, using the agile process provides you with so many advantages. Even in school, the Software Engineering class introduced us to the Agile process. It is one of the best methods out there and one that encourages a lot of growth. I would seriously recommend anyone who has not tried this to give it a shot.<hr>
<b>Marco Studer</b>: The agile way is the right way software should be developed. We should educate our project managers.<hr>

<b>Mike Mahon</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ziaconsulting.com">Zia Consulting, Inc</a>) I have been using XP and Agile Software development with my clients as often as possible for the past 4 years. I have had a difficult time getting new clients to work with an agile software development process.<hr>
<a href="mailto:stanley@unwiredmind.co.kr">Stanley Park</a>.<hr>
<b>Alexander Fedin</b>: There are just few ways to MAKE CUSTOMERS HAPPY. I believe that Agile process is the most effective one.<hr>
<a href="mailto:umasabarish@yahoo.com">Sabarish</a>:  (<a href="http://bify.net">Bluechip Infoway</a>) I find the agile methodologies very interesting. We are facing the challenges mentioned in the various documents that are intended to be solved by Agile techniques everyday.

A combination of agile methodologies and a tool that will allow externalization of business processes will provide much better value to end customers. Externalization of rules will further reduce the time required for each iteration. Reducing time for each iteration is what can make Agile practice successful. <hr>

<a href="mailto:shaikphakeer@yahoo.com">Shaik Pakeer Babu</a>:  (CoOptions Technologies Limited) I have read Mr.Alistair Cockburn&#39;s Agile Software Deveopment book.In deed it is a parcticle approach, which other wise we waste lot of time in documentation and coordination.Currently.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sahayaraj@gmail.com">Sahayaraj Soosainavis</a>: I have seen too many software development projects get caught in the &#39;Process Quagmire&#39; where eventually a few individuals defying conventional &quot;wisdom&quot; have to save the day in the end! To me this seems to capture the essence of what some of us have been doing secretly over the years anyway!. Is the world finally ready for &#39;common sense&#39; rather than &#39;hype&#39;! I am glad that finally we can concentrate on producing working software rather than producing reems of documentation to prove that &quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault!&quot;. At the very least I am glad that we can at least openly talk about it now! And because of that I am all for it!! There is hope after all!!!<hr>
