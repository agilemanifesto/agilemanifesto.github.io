<b>David Traish</b>:  (GROUPAMA UK Services) I have always believed in these principles which is why a long time ago I ditched the Mainframe world for the newly emerging PC world. I could see the power a personal PC could give to users in that it would give them a chance to have a greater say in the design of software than the usual mainfrane environment would give them. I still cannot understand how the majority of IT organisations can say that all design must be complete before development is undertaken. I work in the .NET environemnt where it is very easy to put together a prototype that can be moulded by Users into what they really want. How can you expect users to get the best out of a system where they do not know what the development possibilities are themselves.
I could say an enormous amount about the IT industry, having been part of it for 45 years. This is a revolution that should have come much earlier.<hr>
<b>Sandy Morgan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mainlinemenswear.co.uk">Lyle and Scott</a>) I think this is really positive and am happy to support the Agile Manifesto<hr>
<a href="mailto:mubbashir11@gmail.com">Ahmed Mubbashir Khan</a>: Agile have changing the way people Develop softwares, and now its changing the way people test a Software. 
The more I play with the software the better I know it (working software), the more I collaborate with the customer more I learn what is to be done (Customer collaboration).  <hr>
<a href="mailto:ssharma89@csc.com">Sushil K Sharma</a>:  (<a href="http://www.csc.com">Computer Sciences Corporation</a>) Let&#39;s adopt Agile to achieve customer satisfaction by collaboration, delivering the workable product in very short period and quickly responding to the changes.<hr>
<a href="mailto:aminulhaq@msn.com">Aminulhaq</a>: Highest priority is to satisfy the customer.
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.<hr>

<b>Don Chapman</b>: Collaborating with customers as individuals to effectively respond to inevitable change over &quot;that is what I asked for but not what I want&quot;  <hr>
<a href="mailto:pstubner@gmail.com">Patrick Stubner</a>:  (UBS AG) There are always a lot of changes in the IT, but there wasn&#39;t anything else, that makes me proud to be part of it.<hr>
<b>Rich Edward</b>:  (<a href="http://filipinachat.net">http://filipinachat.net</a>) Software development has encouraged the world to interact with each other in a way and a time frame never thought of before. Collaboration of those from all over the world can and does improve the connectivity and opportunities for those inclined.<hr>
<b>Steve Wagner</b>:  (Microsoft) <hr>
<a href="mailto:rcg.ltd@rogers.com">Don Ritchie</a>:  (Ritchie Consulting Group Ltd.) <td width="233"><b>Ernest Cook</b>:  (<a href="http://www.betterideagroup.com">Better Idea Group</a>) Great job on this. I find it a very interesting manifesto that closely mirrors what I have been doing in my business for many years. <hr>
<b>Gerard Byrne</b>:  (Experience IT) There is only one way. And this is it.<hr>
<b>Kristian Brandser</b>:  (<a href="http://www.knowit.no">Know IT Objectnet AS</a>) Using the Agile Manifesto for a presentation today. I think it sums up the &quot;right&quot; way we should be thinking of agile project development.

Thanks for your good work :)

CSM, Kristian<hr>
<b>Robert jacoby</b>:  (Yahoo!) Software is about the users -- 
low overhead, quick delivey, and exceeded expectations<hr>
<a href="mailto:samuelrugg@yahoo.co.jp">Samuel Ruggieri</a>:  (<a href="http://code-writer.net">Code-Writer Dot Net</a>) The twelve principles stated so eloquently in this manifesto are the zenith of software engineering. A pronounced focus on the customer and consistent, rapid deployment of working products are worth more than all the heavyweight protocols on earth. Whenever I build software, I aspire to embody the notions espoused in this manifesto.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wangttao@cn.ibm.com">Tao Wang</a>:  (IBM) Our teams are practicing Agile during performance testing. The key success criteria I have identified for performance testing is
1. Flexibility (test environment, user scenarios, customer requirement)
2. Value (each round of test must have some value to the overall project)
3. Communication (between developers, FVT testers, PM, Architect)
The manifesto posted on this site provides the high level guidance on how to be Agile!<hr>

<b>Daniel Sarosi</b>:  (Sarosi IT Solutions) This is the kind of stuff that makes sense sense to me.  Once you go Agile, there is no way to going back.<hr>
<a href="mailto:vrodriguez@info-arch.com">Hugo Rodríguez</a>:  (Info-Arch Bolivia) I started this year 2008 with agile, I m very happy about this. <hr>
<a href="mailto:gpranesh7@gmail.com">Pranesh Ganesh</a>: Totally Changed my perspective of testing. I am used to Waterfall model and i have been slowly moving to Agile projects. This was a great help!<hr>

<b>Bernie Pruss</b>:  (<a href="http://www.InfoSynQ.com">InfoSynQ Technologies</a>) Love it, live it. Especially love maximizing the amount of work not done!  <td width="233"><a href="mailto:cbartal@gmail.com">Craig  Bartal</a>:  (CA) This was the past and should be the future!

MS Project does nothing but lock a project into the failure of every week link and doom it to cost and time overruns while delivering a sub par product.

Pure, fluid, transparent collaboration is the key. 

Business software, especially, is stifled by rigid, yet ambiguous and mal-formed business requirements that leave the development force laughing and the end user crying.

Agile! A change we can believe in!<hr>
<a href="mailto:tony@iq247.co.za">Antonio Franco</a>: Agile has changed my life. Logic has finally prevailed.<hr>

<b>Doug Shimp</b>:  (<a href="http://www.3back.com/scrum-training">3Back LLC</a>)  While I find value in the first 3 items listed in the manifesto. I find only the last one really speaks to agility. There is content in the 1st three that is notable and has substance as a general statement of the humans. However, the notion of agility is only partially express and that is only the last item. ...Responding to change over following a plan... http://advancedtopicsinscrum.com<hr>

<b>Aravinda Krishnan R.</b>:  (<a href="http://www.lbinfotech.com">Lattice Bridge Infotech</a>) I have been practicing Agile Development without knowing that it is called Agile. I am a Customer-Centric person and I feel that Customer has every right to change his requirements at any point of time, before, during and after development and it is our responsibility to deliver the changes. After all, he is paying for our bread!<hr>

<a href="mailto:tomasz@grochowski.net.pl">Tomasz Grochowski</a>: People are the most important. The manifesto follows the sentence. Looks simple but is more difficult in implemenntation then any formal methodology. It desires mature customers and mature contractors. Anyway, I buy it!<hr>
